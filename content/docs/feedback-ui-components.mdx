# Introduction
If you are using React, there us noo more needs to build your user feedback button, our UI component can do the work for you.

# How this works
## Register and create project
Go to https://www.llmfeedback.com/register, connect your github account, and create a new project in the dashboard

## Install llm-feedback-client NodeJS SDK
````mdx
npm install llm-feedback-client@latest
````

## Create a client in your app:
```ts showLineNumbers {3}
import { Client, ThumbsUpDown } from "llm-feedback-client"
import '@radix-ui/themes/styles.css'; //import the CSS since we are using radix-ui/themes for the component

const feedbackClient = new Client({
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' // Just use any string for now
});
```

## Add your UI component:
We currently support Thumbs-Up-Down component, with a Thumbs-Up and a Thumbs-Down choice, and a comment area
```ts showLineNumbers {3}
<ThumbsUpDown client={feedebackClient} contentId={aiContendId}/>
```

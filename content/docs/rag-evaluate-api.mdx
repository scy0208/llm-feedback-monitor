# Introduction
Based on databricks's recent reseach https://www.databricks.com/blog/LLM-auto-eval-best-practices-RAG
on LLM Evaluation of RAG Applications, we build and endpoint to easily evaluate the RAG Q&A and make it as an online “LLMs as a judge” 
For each provided context, question and answer, give your score and reasoning (5 to 30 words) for the correctness, helpfulness,
comprehensiveness and readability of the answer. Our grading standard is as follow:

- Correctness: If the answer correctly answer the question, below are the details for different scores:
  - Score 0: the answer is completely incorrect, doesn’t mention anything about the question or is completely contrary to the correct answer.
  - Score 1: the answer provides some relevance to the question and answer one aspect of the question correctly.
  - Score 2: the answer mostly answer the question but is missing or hallucinating on one critical aspect.
  - Score 3: the answer correctly answer the question and not missing any major aspect
- Helpfulness: Evaluate the directness, completeness, and relevancy of the answer to the given question without. Consider the following scoring criteria:
  - Score 0: The answer is completely off-topic or irrelevant to the question, providing no useful information.
  - Score 1: The answer leaves gaps that would require the user to seek information elsewhere for a complete answer.
  - Score 2: The answer directly resolve most part the question. But didn't resolve all details of the question.
  - Score 3: The answer fully and directly addresses every part of the question, providing a complete solution or recommendation without the need for further inquiry. 
  - Score 3: If an answer involves asking for more details or follow-up questions, it should not be scored a 3, as it is not a complete solution in itself.)
- Comprehensiveness: How comprehensive is the answer, does it fully answer all aspects of the question and provide comprehensive explanation and other necessary information. Below are the details for different scores:
  - Score 0: typically if the answer is completely incorrect, then the comprehensiveness is also zero score.
  - Score 1: if the answer is correct but too short to fully answer the question, then we can give score 1 for comprehensiveness.
  - Score 2: the answer is correct and roughly answer the main aspects of the question, but it’s missing description about details. Or is completely missing details about one minor aspect.
  - Score 3: the answer is correct, and covers all the main aspects of the question


Evaluate API is POST API helps evaluate the instruction is fully followed by the response.
Here are the necessary parameters in the POST body

--data '{"project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", 
"question": "What'\''s shipment policy shiiping to Mississippi in summer?", 
"answer": "During the summer season, all shipments to shippable states are currently on hold due to weather conditions. However, you have two options:1. You can choose **expedited shipping with ice packs** for an additional cost of at least $20.2. You can select **Ground shipping** and wait until the weather hold is lifted in the fall.",
"context": "Rule No.1: Please note that due to weather conditions, all shipments to Shippable States are currently on hold for the summer season. If you wish to receive your shipment promptly, we kindly request that you choose an expedited shipping method. Please be aware that opting for expedited shipping will automatically include the use of ice packs, incurring an additional cost of at least $20 for the ice packs. However, if you select Ground shipping, your order will not be shipped until the weather hold is lifted in the fall. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nRhode Island[edit] Direct shipment of wine is prohibited in Rhode Island for off-site sales; consumers may place on-site orders for shipment at wineries.\nSouth Carolina[edit] Consumers in South Carolina are limited to 2 cases per person shipped directly to them per month.\nSouth Dakota[edit] Consumers in South Dakota are limited to 12 cases shipped directly to them annually.\nTennessee[edit] Wineries may ship no more than one case per month, nor three per year, directly to an individual consumer in Tennessee.\nTexas[edit] Consumers in Texas are limited to nine gallons monthly and no more than 36 gallons annually shipped directly per person.\nUtah[edit] sales and/or excise taxes. Most states also limit the quantity of wine that may be purchased monthly or annually, usually in terms of the number of nine-liter cases of wine that may be shipped, though most consumers are unaffected by these limits. Shipment of wine to dry areas is illegal.\nIn the 2005 case Granholm v. Heald, the Supreme Court ruled that states must regulate direct shipment of wines to consumers from in-state and out-of-state wineries in the same way, either allowing or banning both. Since that ruling, more states gradually began to allow direct shipment of wine from wineries to consumers. Some states also allow direct shipment of wine from out-of-state retailers to consumers.\nLaws by state[edit] [1][2]\nAlabama[edit]\nMississippi[edit] Direct shipment of wine is prohibited in Mississippi.\nMissouri[edit] Consumers in Missouri are limited to 2 cases shipped directly to them per month.\nMontana[edit] Consumers in Montana are limited to 18 cases shipped directly to them annually.\nNebraska[edit] Consumers in Nebraska are limited to 12 cases shipped directly to them annually.\nNevada[edit] Consumers in Nevada are limited to 12 cases shipped directly to them annually.\nNew Hampshire[edit] Consumers in New Hampshire are limited to 12 cases shipped directly to them annually.\nNew Jersey[edit] Only small wineries that make less than 250,000 gallons of wine annually are allowed to ship up to 12 cases of wine per year to consumers in New Jersey.\nNew Mexico[edit] Consumers in New Mexico are limited to 2 cases per person shipped directly to them per month.\nNew York[edit] Consumers in New York are limited to 36 cases per person shipped directly to them annually.\nNorth Carolina[edit]"
